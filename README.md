**	INFERENCE :-**
We wanted to analyze the key features and trends of the HR Dataset of a company based on which we could determine critical decisions to drive employee productivity. In my analysis, I have tried to add knowledge about headcount and demographic statistics.
I tried to analyze the leave reason of the employees by department using Sankey Chart which will also help the company to know the total number of leaves by department. An insight into the employee details will certainly help us tounderstand the engagement of employees in their respective works as well as their performances. Based on the analysis of employee details, the company can easily figure out the good and bad hires.
A good way to determine the sincerity of employees by department is by looking at the line chart showing last thirty days late by department as well as the bar chart showing average absences by department. As, we see the attrition rate is high       (that is 50%), thus it means that the employees are leaving the company frequently.
Actually, human resources are a key element in the success or failure of monitoring programmes to meet their objectives. Without an adequate strategy to develop the human resources available and attract high calibre staff, monitoring programmes rapidly stagnate.
